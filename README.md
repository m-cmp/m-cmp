# Multi-Cloud Management Platform
Integrated mirror for all subsystems in multi-cloud management platform (M-CMP)

## Introduction
This project develops a multi-cloud management platform (M-CMP) technology that overcomes
the complexities of utilizing and managing various heterogeneous clouds. This technology
aims to enable the deployment, operation, and management of services without constraints
on computing infrastructure, by providing large-scale data analysis-based services and
cost optimization.
