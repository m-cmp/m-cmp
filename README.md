# Multi-Cloud Management Platform
Integrated mirror for all subsystems in multi-cloud management platform (M-CMP)

## Introduction
This project develops a multi-cloud management platform (M-CMP) technology that overcomes
the complexities of utilizing and managing various heterogeneous clouds. This technology
aims to enable the deployment, operation, and management of services without constraints
on computing infrastructure, by providing large-scale data analysis-based services and
cost optimization.

This repository serves as an integrated archive for major Multi-Cloud management features.
The included repositories are listed in the root directory.

The main subsystems and tools included are as follows:

- **MC Infra Connector**: Connects all clouds in a single interface, facilitating dynamic multi-cloud integration. It offers unified APIs for the dynamic connection and control of multi-cloud resources and services.
  - [Upstream repository](https://github.com/m-cmp/mc-infra-connector)

- **MC Infra Manager**: Manages multi-cloud infrastructures, integrating various heterogeneous cloud infrastructure resources in the form of a single private cloud.
  - [Upstream repository](https://github.com/m-cmp/mc-infra-manager)

- **MC Application Manager**: Manages multi-cloud applications, focusing on deploying applications across multi-cloud infrastructures.
  - [Upstream repository](https://github.com/m-cmp/mc-application-manager)

- **MC Across Service Manager**: Manages multi-cloud services, providing functionalities like cloud-to-cloud migration and dynamic performance management.
  - [Upstream repository](https://github.com/m-cmp/mc-across-service-manager)

- **MC Workflow Manager**: Manages multi-cloud workflows and automation, enabling the creation of workflows for deploying infrastructures and applications across clouds.
  - [Upstream repository](https://github.com/m-cmp/mc-workflow-manager)

- **MC Cost Optimizer**: Focuses on cloud cost optimization across various clouds.
  - [Upstream repository](https://github.com/m-cmp/mc-cost-optimizer)

- **MC IAM Manager**: Manages Identity and Access Management across multi-cloud platforms, providing account/role management and access control.
  - [Upstream repository](https://github.com/m-cmp/mc-iam-manager)

- **MC Web Console**: Offers a web-based GUI for managing various clouds, as part of the Multi-Cloud Project.
  - [Upstream repository](https://github.com/m-cmp/mc-web-console)
